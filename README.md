This repository demonstrates a common but often overlooked issue in Dockerfiles: the use of an outdated base image and an unspecified Python version.  The original Dockerfile uses `ubuntu:latest`, which can lead to unpredictable behavior across different builds. Additionally, relying on the default Python version can cause compatibility issues with project dependencies. The solution provides an updated Dockerfile that addresses these issues by explicitly specifying the Python version and using a slimmer base image.
